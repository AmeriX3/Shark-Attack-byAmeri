## **Hypothesis**:
## -Does Australia have the most **dangerous** waters



### We all know how dangerous Australia's wildlife can but, does that also translate to its **waters**?
---
#### First thing that should be done was cleaning the Data from all bad entres and after that we can have an over view of all the attacks throughout the years

### All The attacks around the world
#### This graph shows the steady attack of sharks throughout the years with an upsurge in the 1960's. The gradually increasing attacks can be to population growth or the increase of water activity throughout the years.
#### the issue with this graph is that it shows all sort of attacks, but sometimes the attacks are from people who are provoking the sharks. what of the more sane people who mind their busniess?

### Unprovoked Attacks
#### The attacks are very similar to the total number of attacks which tells us that a good sum of the attacks happen out of the blue. also the surge in the 1960 has lesser value but still a great surge.

### Provoked Attacks
#### The 1960 Spike in provoked attacks is the highest in all time. It seems that people of the 1960's dont have much respect for sharks. After the spike comes a great fall into the relative normal amount of provoked rates which slowly rises with the natural curve

## Unprovoked countries top 4
#### After filtering the data I picked the highest values for the countries and we can immediatlly dissprove the hypthesis. Intresting America seems to be the leading in the shark attacks. Now the question is answered as America. But what place in America has the highest chance to be attacked.

## Unprovoked Attacks in the USA
#### Somewhat predictable Florida has the most attacks by a extremly high margin. If you were to swim in the florida's coastline keep an eye out for sharks. since the count of 800 attacks of all the USA happen in.
